# Adam Dernis WorkSample

This repo contains excerpts of code from my projects that I am especially proud of and I believe demonstrate my ability to write reliable, readable, and efficient code.

### Sample 1: [MIPS InstructionParser](https://github.com/Avid29/WorkSample/blob/master/MIPS/InstructionParser.cs)

This is an excerpt from my [MIPS.Interpreter](https://github.com/Avid29/MIPS.Interpreter) project. It parses MIPS assembly strings into binary encoded instructions.

### Sample 2: [MarqueeText control](https://github.com/Avid29/WorkSample/blob/master/MarqueeText/MarqueeText.cs)

This is an excerpt from the [Windows Community Toolkit Labs](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-Windows). It is a control I wrote and contributed that was accepted as a labs project. It is scheduled for release in the full Windows Community Toolkit with version 9.0.

### Sample 3: [Ray Tracing Renderer](https://github.com/Avid29/WorkSample/blob/master/RenderSharp/RayTraceRenderer.cs)

This is an excerpt from my project [RenderSharp](https://github.com/Avid29/RenderSharp). It is an implementation of my IRenderer interface that will use ray tracing to render a scene of 3D objects to a texture buffer.


###### *All code present is an excerpt of a larger project, and is most likely missing many dependencies. It should not compile.*
