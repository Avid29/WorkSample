# Adam Dernis WorkSample

This repo contains excerpts of code from my projects that I am especially proud of and I believe demonstrate my ability to write reliable, readable, and efficient code.

### Sample 1: [MIPS InstructionParser](https://github.com/Avid29/WorkSample/blob/master/MIPS/InstructionParser.cs)

This is an excerpt from my [MIPS.Interpreter](https://github.com/Avid29/MIPS.Interpreter) project. It parses strings into binary instructions.
